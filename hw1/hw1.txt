1. Jack views programming as a design activity.

2. Programming and the build/test cycle are central to the process of building     software and software can represent almost anything. This makes it unlikely 
   that we will find a general purpose for all software,

3.Jack belives c++ makes it easier to design software and program at the same
  time.

4.The reason software engineers don't adhere as strictly to the same design, refine, test strategy as other engineers is because while designing software is
really expensive, actually building it is really cheap. So instead of trying to prove it. We just build and test.
